# we build a website that can be used as a chat site a little like facebook.

# we have made a database in phpmyadmin where you have to make a database with the name db2 because we were not able to export the database
# otherwise you just have to edit some code in connectDB.php
# and you have to import our table, it is called login

# we starts on a page called index.php, it is our home page where we have a dropdown menu
# here you can choose between signup and login.

# on our signup page, we take the userinput and put them into our database then the button Created is pressed

# on our login page we check's the userinput that it checks out with an user in your database after the button login is pressed
# afterwards you will be directed onto our profile page, where is shows with user is logged in, it comes in a form of welcome "username"


# all flowcharts has to be opened as a picture
